Hey, my name is Kade Carlson, I plan on becoming an entrepreneur in the tech business. I have lots of ideas right now and I figured I should probably start to learn how to code so that's why I am here. I'm interested in a lot of different types of code specifically Java, Python, Ruby, and HTML and SCSS. I know quite a bit about HTML so far and plan to learn a lot more about different programming languages.
